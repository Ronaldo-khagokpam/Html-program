
Channel of Communication:-
Channel and media cannot be chosen indiscriminately. The choice depends on need, context, purpose, cost and convenience.
The written channel is chosen when:
?	immediate feedback is not required;
?	the message is detailed and complex;
?	the recipients are geographically dispersed;
?	the message has to be in tact or least distorted; and
?	when a permanent record is necessary.
The oral channel is chosen when:
?	no permanent record of the transaction is needed;
?	one-to-one interaction is important to solve a problem; and when the receipt is at hand.
The audio-visual channel is chosen when:
?	understanding needs reinforcement;
?	marketing of products requires it;
?	concepts need to be simplified with the aid of pictures and animation;
?	surgical remedies are made; and when 
?	instructionalaids are required to accompany oral presentations.

Formal and Informal Communication:-
	Formal Communication:-The term formal refers to a style or form of writing, speaking or behaviour which is very correct and suitable for important occasions or official purposes.
	Informal Communication:-The term informal refers to a relaxed and friendly attitude which does not require strict rules of how to behave or speak or dress or write.
The advantages of formal communication are as follow:-
?	The formal flow of communication ensures information flow. Employees down the line receive their daily share of mail and information to get the organization working in order to perform. Similarly those who send information up in the form of reports, proposals and other forms of feedback enable managers at higher levels take informed decisions for the development of the organization. Such information flow is vital to an organization.
?	A favourable image of the organization is built up through formal correspondence, when it is prompt and pleasant. This, in turn, increases its credibility and reliability.
?	Formal organizational communication promotes teamworkand coordination. This eventually generates a high quality work ethic and this, in turn, can promote efficiency.
?	Formal communication, moreover, ensures centralized control down the levels of hierarchy.
?	Division of work: Sharing, cooperation and facilitation of the performance of managerial tasks are some of the other advantages. These built the process of democratic functioning into the system.
The disadvantages of formal communication are as follow:-
?	Formal demarcations limit individual freedom and inhibit lower level workers from freely interacting with higher level supervisory functionaries.
?	Formal communication is time-consuming and expensive.
?	It encourages filtering of information by delaying it for either strategic reasons or for denying privileges or advantages meant for those who deserve them. 
Grapevine: The Informal Network of Communication
	The term means the complex network of communication in an organization which conveys rumours and comments under the pretence of secrecy. The communication is casual and informal.
Similar to Grapevine network of Communication, we have:-
?	The Single Strand Chain:-The first is the Single Strand Chain. A tells something in disguised secrecy to B, and B transmits it to C in the same way. ‘Hi Chand, I hear from reliable sources that our company is going to crash shortly’ and Chand communicates this to Govind in the factory. More often than not, such information is far from the truth but the grapevine has done its job: it has raised an alarm to cause sufficient worry to the managers.
 
?	The Gossip Chain:-The second channel is the Gossip Chain. In this, one person transmits a rumour to whoever he or she meets under cover of anonymity. ‘Hi, did you hear that our boss is going to divorce his wife?’ The gossip spreads like wildfire leading to character assassination in most cases. The gossip chain does not often carry official matters as much as it carries tales behind backs. Generally gossip generates from disgruntled or dissatisfied workers and from rivals.
 
?	The Cluster Chain:-The Cluster Chain grapevine operates among a select group of individuals who, in turn, communicate to another select group, usually called liaison individuals. They informally carry information to spokesmen of departments in order to draw the attention of the management. A subordinate may tell a few of his friends in higher levels of the hierarchy, ‘Sir, some of the employees in the computer section are contemplating the possibility of joining another company where they pay higher salaries.’ Members of the cluster who receive this grapevine in organizations. Sometimes it is used by the management to leak out information in advance about decisions to come.
 
?	The Probability Chain:-The Probability Chain  is used to pass on amusing information which may be interesting but not generally important. One who grapevines through this chain is indifferent to the recipient of the message. One may address a colleague, ‘You will be shown the door tomorrow, haven’t you offended the boss by commenting on the saree of his wife in his presence?’ While the probability of the boss’s displeasure cannot be ruled out, the possibility of showing the door is remote. Nevertheless the grapevine has been indifferent to whatever hurt she may have caused to her colleague.
 



Advantages and Disadvantages of Grapevine
	a) The grapevine is a valuable network of informal communication and it has several advantages which are as follow:
?	It is the only means by which managers can study the hidden mind of the workforce. This is necessary to frame policies, make decisions and plan development by rectifying shortcomings of the administration if any. The feedback value, is therefore, immense. Savvy managers do not seek to suppress the grapevine; on the contrary, they tap it in order to handle problems before they reach a crisis.
?	The grapevine is the speediest channel of communication. Rumours spread like wildfire. When the management uses it effectively to drop hints by way of countering adverse rumours, the speed with which the hints travel is not matched by that of any formal means of communication and it is beneficial to managers. The ill effects of bad rumours are immediately arrested.
?	Grapevine reinforces formal channels of communication. Thus a circular announcing a pay raise is confidence-inspiring when the rumour about a pay cut has been widely afloat.
?	The grapevine has therapeutic value. When formal communication inhibits free expression of one’s mind, informal communication opens the flood gates of free expression. When one lets out his pent up emotions by assassinating the character of the person he hates most, or conveys false rumours to disparage someone, one may become sober to reflect on the damage done. And that is the right moment for psychological counselling and change of mind. In this way most vehement critics have turned to be staunch supporters of the management.
b) The grapevine has many drawbacks as well which are as follow:
?	The information communicated through grapevine may not be reliable. They cannot be acted upon without discrete corroboration.
?	Grapevine often distorts facts and misinforms. This is detrimental to the interests of an organization when rumours spread outside.
?	Grapevine may send false alarms and raise unnecessary fears to cause mistrust among colleagues. Interpersonal harmony may run the risk of being superseded by conflict. Sometimes it makes crisis management difficult.

Informal External Communication:- 
Informal external communication, which happens in an organization’s external contacts, in both business and social contexts, is recognized to be beneficial. They are, therefore encouraged.

Barriers of Communication:-
	Noise:-Noise may affect the whole communication process. Faulty encoding of the message, wrong choice of channel and medium, imperfect understanding of the message by the recipient and wrong feedback – all may be considered as result of noise.
	Psychological Barrier:-Every mind is unique. It orders experiences shared by others into a unique pattern of its own. As the sender of a romantic message, the youngster may select enchanting features of the rose to encode it. The recipient of the message, who is downhearted, might select negative features of the symbol, such as the thorn, and refuse to conform to the message. This is called selective perception.
	Linguistic Barrier:-The knowledge and use of language by sender and recipient may be different. The difference causes mutual unintelligibility
?	Poor listening may lead to misheard words.
?	Interference of regional features in pronunciation of words may also cause such a barrier.
?	A third linguistic barrier is ambiguity caused by confused syntax or word order.
?	A fourth linguistic barrier may be the difference in accent. Accent may be regional: the speaker of the same language in two different regions or countries may not understand each other.
Fragmentation of Information:-Information gets fragmented in a hierarchical set-up. Restricted areas of information dealt with by different individuals, sections and departments fragment information. Workers, therefore, know only parts of all the information necessary for a company to function. This often results in making blind or wrong decisions.
Unethical Practices:-Unethical practices misinform and they cause miscommunication. A sales representative may present to the Marketing Manager a more than true picture of the sales he has promoted, or planned to promote. The decisions taken on such partially false reports may lead to loss, besides damaging the name of the company. Personal gain, hidden agenda, greed and other unethical factors often block true communication.
Socio-Cultural Barrier:-Intercultural communication, commoner in the present multinational business context, than ever before, causes socio-cultural barriers. Cultures are often classified into two: high context and low context.
?	People who belong to high context cultures rely more or circumstances and non-verbal gestures.
?	On the other hand, people of low context cultures such as those of the US and Germany, rely mostly on verbal communication.
Information Overload:-when we are flooded with information which results in missing out important message. Regulatory devices help to separate the most important from the least in order not to miss out on vital communication.
Goal Conflict:-Communication barriers result when goals are split and are in conflict with each other.
Poor Listening:-Oral communication becomes ineffective because of poor listening. Tuning out pretending to listen but not actually listening), preoccupation (thinking of one’s own interests while pretending to listen), prejudice (unwillingness to listen because the speaker is not liked by the listener) and poor retention of memory (losing chain of through) are some causes of poor listening which often block oral communication. Involved and active listening alone can overcome this barrier.
Impoliteness:-Many telephone conversations end up in jamming receivers because they irritate for want of courtesy. Non-use of courtesy markers such as ‘Would you mind?’, ‘Please’, ‘Thank you’, etc., and polite tones such as the rising or falling-rising intonation and an attitude of deference to the other fails to smoothen communication and to let it flow on.
Filtering:-Blocking out part of, or whole, messages down the line of communication flow may cause partial communication black out. Such a barrier is harmful to decisions which have to be taken on the basis of total information.
